### Introduction

I have seen many people owning macbooks and yes, you love a mac but i have always been wondering that taking control of an environment on which you are highly dependent is a logical thing to do. I have seen people lack the basic skills of re-installing a windows, but when it comes to re-installing a MAC, Damn!, its technical.

```
I think.. "Technical is a term, invented to make people believe that they should not do something that the inventor wants to hide
```

### Booting
